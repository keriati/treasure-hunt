## Arcanis the Chrono-Librarian

With the Archmage's questions answered to its satisfaction, a shimmer passes through the air, and the creature nods
solemnly, acknowledging your wisdom and knowledge. "Well answered, seekers. You have proven your worth, and thus, I
grant you passage deeper into the Library of the Moon." With a graceful nod, the Archmage dissipates into a cloud of
arcane dust, leaving behind only the echo of its voice and a path forward, now unguarded.

As you proceed, the library's walls seem to pulsate with an ancient power, guiding you yet deeper into its heart. The
air is thick with magic, the very stones whispering of ages past. It is not long before you come to another chamber,
this one bathed in a gentle, ethereal light. Here, in the center of the chamber, you find a second guardian, a being of
light and shadow, Arcanis the **Ch**rono-**L**ibrarian. Unlike the Keeper of the Ancient Scripts, this creature exudes
calmness and curiosity, its form constantly shifting, a mesmerizing dance of light.

"Greetings, traveler," the **Chrono-Librarian** speaks, its voice a melody, harmonious and soothing. "You have journeyed
far and proven yourself worthy. But the path ahead is fraught with complexity beyond mere knowledge or bravery. To reach
the Spellbook of Refactoring, you must demonstrate wisdom and insight."

From its form, the **Chrono-Librarian** produces a [map](resources/maze.txt), intricate and detailed, glowing softly
with an inner light. "This map," it continues, "represents the library that lies before you. But beware, for the
library is ever-changing, a puzzle that shifts with the sands of time. Only by finding the shortest path will you reach
the spellbook and, with it, a way back to the world you know."

With a gesture of farewell, the **Chrono-Librarian** fades away, leaving you alone with the map. The task is clear:
using the map, you must determine the shortest path through the library to the **Spellbook of Refactoring**. The journey
will require all your skills in algorithms, for a wrong turn could lead you astray, lost in the maze forever.

**Mark the shortest path from "A" to "B" on the [map](resources/maze.txt) with red X characters to pass this
challenge.**
