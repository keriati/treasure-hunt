                    Having navigated the library's twists and turns with unmatched skill and wisdom,
                    you finally arrive at the heart of the maze. Here, in a chamber carved from the
                    very essence of Azeroth itself, lies the
                    <strong>Spellbook of Refactoring</strong>. Its glow bathes the room in a soft,
                    ethereal light, casting long shadows that dance along the walls. As you step
                    forward to claim the spellbook, a sense of accomplishment fills your being.
                    But this moment of triumph is soon overshadowed by an unexpected discovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the <strong>Spellbook of Refactoring</strong> pulses in your hand, the
                    chamber at the heart of the Library of the Moon reveals its final mystery.
                    <strong>Q</strong>uantum <strong>A</strong>rcanites, tiny glowing creatures,
                    awakened by the spellbook's magic, start to fill the room with their
                    luminescence. Observing their behavior, you quickly discern a pattern to their
                    multiplication, a key that will determine your fate and the urgency of your
                    escape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These creatures, after appearing, spend the first <strong>3 seconds</strong> in
                    a state of curiosity, exploring their immediate surroundings with an innocent
                    wonder. But once these initial 3 seconds pass, each creature begins to spawn a
                    new companion every <strong>7 seconds</strong>, a cycle of birth that each of
                    their offspring continues after their own 3-second period of acclimatization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With 8 of these creatures currently illuminating the chamber, their numbers are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 creatures that appeared 5 seconds ago</li>
                    <li>2 creatures that emerged 4 seconds ago</li>
                    <li>1 creature that materialized 3 seconds ago</li>
                    <li>1 creature that appeared 2 seconds ago</li>
                    <li>2 creatures that burst into existence just now</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The realization hits you; in 5 seconds, the number of creatures will be 10 as
                    the oldest among them spawn their first offspring. You also calculate that in
                    the 10th second from now there will be 16 creatures, and in the 20th second from
                    now there will be 36 creatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The library, vast as it is, can only contain up to 19 billion of these creatures
                    before becoming completely impassable (according to your estimates).
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the knowledge of their multiplication pattern and the current count in
                    hand, you begin to calculate how long you have before the library fills with the
                    glowing swarm, rendering escape impossible. This calculation will not only
                    require your sharp intellect but also a deep understanding of exponential growth
                    and the ability to forecast their population under the constraints of time.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        How much time (in seconds) do you have to get out of the library before it
                        will contain more than 19 billion arcanites and becomes completely
                        impassable?
