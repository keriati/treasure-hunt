                <p>
                    As you descend into the dimly lit corridors of the Library of the Moon, the air
                    grows cold, and a sense of anticipation fills your bones. The winding path leads
                    you to a vast corridor, illuminated by crystals pulsating with arcane energy. In
                    the center of the corridor stands a guardian, a creature of legend and magic:
                    <strong>The Archmage of Code, Keeper of the Ancient Scripts</strong>, its silver
                    hair shimmering with the colors of the spellbound crystals surrounding it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Archmage fixes its ancient, wise eyes upon you, and in a voice that
                    resonates through the very stone beneath your feet, it speaks. "Greetings,
                    seeker of the <strong>Spellbook of Refactoring</strong>. I am the guardian of
                    this path, and to pass beyond, you must answer my three questions. Beware, for
                    truth is the key; a single falsehood, and you shall not proceed."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The air around you seems to thicken with magic as the Archmage poses its
                    challenges:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        "In the halls of valor and code, where heroes and developers alike dare
                        tread, tell me, what style of testing does Leeroy Jenkins and the
                        <strong>W</strong>isdom <strong>Ch</strong>annelers hold most dear? A method
                        that charges ahead, fearless and bold, seeking glory in every test run."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Now, brave adventurer, name the three words of vagueness, terms so
                        imprecise, that uttering them in your test descriptions would summon the
                        wrath of the goblin hidden in shadows. These words, like mist, obscure
                        clarity and invite doom upon those who dare speak them in haste."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Lastly, a question of wisdom passed through ages, a mantra for those who
                        shape the world through code. Who is the sage who uttered these timeless
                        words: 'First, make the change easy, then make the easy change'? Speak the
                        name of this visionary, and you shall prove your worth."
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The Archmage falls silent, its gaze piercing. The crystalsâ€™ glow seems to pulse
                    in rhythm with your heartbeat as you ponder the answers. Your journey through
                    the code has prepared you for this moment, and with confidence, you begin to
                    respond, knowing that each answer brings you one step closer to the
                    <strong>Spellbook of Refactoring</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Write your answers on a piece of paper and hand the paper to the Archmage to
                        pass this challenge.
                    </strong>
