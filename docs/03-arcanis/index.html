                    With the Archmage's questions answered to its satisfaction, a shimmer passes
                    through the air, and the creature nods solemnly, acknowledging your wisdom and
                    knowledge. "Well answered, seekers. You have proven your worth, and thus, I
                    grant you passage deeper into the Library of the Moon." With a graceful nod, the
                    Archmage dissipates into a cloud of arcane dust, leaving behind only the echo of
                    its voice and a path forward, now unguarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you proceed, the library's walls seem to pulsate with an ancient power,
                    guiding you yet deeper into its heart. The air is thick with magic, the very
                    stones whispering of ages past. It is not long before you come to another
                    chamber, this one bathed in a gentle, ethereal light. Here, in the center of the
                    chamber, you find a second guardian, a being of light and shadow, Arcanis the
                    <strong>Ch</strong>rono-<strong>L</strong>ibrarian. Unlike the Keeper of the
                    Ancient Scripts, this creature exudes calmness and curiosity, its form
                    constantly shifting, a mesmerizing dance of light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Greetings, traveler," the <strong>Chrono-Librarian</strong> speaks, its voice a melody,
                    harmonious and soothing. "You have journeyed far and proven yourself worthy. But
                    the path ahead is fraught with complexity beyond mere knowledge or bravery. To
                    reach the Spellbook of Refactoring, you must demonstrate wisdom and insight."
                </p>
                <p>
                    From its form, the <strong>Chrono-Librarian</strong> produces a
                    <a title="Maze input" href="maze.txt" target="_blank">map</a>, intricate and
                    detailed, glowing softly with an inner light. "This map," it continues,
                    "represents the library that lies before you. But beware, for the library is
                    ever-changing, a puzzle that shifts with the sands of time. Only by finding the
                    shortest path will you reach the spellbook and, with it, a way back to the world
                    you know."
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a gesture of farewell, the <strong>Chrono-Librarian</strong> fades away,
                    leaving you alone with the map. The task is clear: using the map, you must
                    determine the shortest path through the library to the
                    <strong>Spellbook of Refactoring</strong>. The journey will require all your
                    skills in algorithms, for a wrong turn could lead you astray, lost in the maze
                    forever.

                    <strong>
                        Mark the shortest path from "A" to "B" on the
                        <a title="Maze input" href="maze.txt" target="_blank">map</a> with red X
                        characters to pass this challenge.
