## The Quantum Arcanites

Having navigated the library's twists and turns with unmatched skill and wisdom, you finally arrive at the heart of the
maze. Here, in a chamber carved from the very essence of Azeroth itself, lies the **Spellbook of Refactoring**. Its glow
bathes the room in a soft, ethereal light, casting long shadows that dance along the walls. As you step forward to claim
the spellbook, a sense of accomplishment fills your being. But this moment of triumph is soon overshadowed by an
unexpected discovery.

As the **Spellbook of Refactoring** pulses in your hand, the chamber at the heart of the Library of the Moon reveals its
final mystery. **Q**uantum **A**rcanites, tiny glowing creatures, awakened by the spellbook's magic, start to fill the
room with their luminescence. Observing their behavior, you quickly discern a pattern to their multiplication, a key
that will determine your fate and the urgency of your escape.

These creatures, after appearing, spend the first 3 seconds in a state of curiosity, exploring their immediate
surroundings with an innocent wonder. But once these initial 3 seconds pass, each creature begins to spawn a new
companion every 7 seconds, a cycle of birth that each of their offspring continues after their own 3-second period of
acclimatization.

With 8 of these creatures currently illuminating the chamber, their numbers are:

- 2 creatures that appeared 6 seconds ago
- 2 creatures that emerged 5 seconds ago
- 1 creature that materialized 4 seconds ago
- 1 creature that appeared 3 seconds ago
- 2 creatures that burst into existence merely 1 second ago

The realization hits you; in just 4 seconds (in the 5th second from now), the number of creatures will increase from 8
to 10 as the oldest among them spawn their first offspring. You also calculate that in the 10th second from now there 
will be 16 creatures, and in the 20th second from now there will be 36 creatures.

The library, vast as it is, can only contain up to 18 billion of these creatures before becoming completely impassable
(according to your estimates).

With the knowledge of their multiplication pattern and the current count in hand, you begin to calculate how long you
have before the library fills with the glowing swarm, rendering escape impossible. This calculation will not only
require your sharp intellect but also a deep understanding of exponential growth and the ability to forecast their
population under the constraints of time.

**How much time (in seconds) do you have to get out of the library before it will contain more then 18 billion 
arcanites and becomes completely impassable?**
